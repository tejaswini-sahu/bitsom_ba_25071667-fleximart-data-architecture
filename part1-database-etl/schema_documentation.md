            M : 1 with orders

            M : 1 with products

2. Normalization and 3NF Explanation 

    The FlexiMart database is designed in Third Normal Form (3NF) to minimize redundancy and avoid anomalies.

    In the customers table, non-key attributes such as name, email, phone, city and registration_date depend directly on the primary key customer_id. There are no repeating groups and no partial dependencies because no composite key exists.

    In the products table, all attributes such as product_name, category, price and stock_quantity depend only on the primary key product_id, satisfying 2NF and 3NF conditions.

    The orders table contains order-level data, where order_id is the primary key. Non-key attributes such as order_date, total_amount and status depend only on order_id, while customer_id is a foreign key linking customers without embedding duplicate customer details.

    The order_items table ensures that details of multiple products per order are stored without repetition. Each row uniquely identifies an item within an order using order_item_id. Attributes quantity, unit_price, and subtotal depend only on this primary key.

    This design prevents:

        Update anomaly: Customer information is stored in one place only

         anomaly: A new product can be added without needing an order

        Delete anomaly: Deleting an order does not remove product or customer records

    By separating entities into logical tables and linking them using foreign keys, the database satisfies 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF, resulting in a well-structured relational schema with integrity and minimal redundancy.
