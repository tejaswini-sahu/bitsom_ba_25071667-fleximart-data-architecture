Overview of the NoSQL (MongoDB) Module

In this part of the project, FlexiMart wants to check whether MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is suitable for storing its growing and highly diverse product catalog. Unlike a traditional relational database, products in FlexiMart can have different types of attributes (for example, mobiles have RAM and battery, while shoes have size and color). You will study when NoSQL is useful and then perform basic MongoDB operations.

The work is divided into two main tasks:

Task 2.1 – NoSQL Justification Report
You will write a short report explaining:

why relational databases struggle with flexible product data

how MongoDB’s document model and flexible schema help

what advantages and disadvantages MongoDB has

Task 2.2 – MongoDB Implementation
You will use MongoDB to:

import a product catalog JSON file

run basic queries

analyze product reviews

update documents

perform aggregation such as average price per category
